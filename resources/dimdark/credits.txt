Thanks to the small things, squirming under the earth,
writhing in conflicted hearts, squealing newly-born.
Thanks to the sun that always rises,
and the moon that moves the world.
Thanks to my wife,
my friends,
and my mentors,
for believing in me.

I owe this game to inspirations like
Super Mario RPG and Final Fantasy IX,
Diablo II and Path of Exile,
and especially Wildermyth
for showing me the spans
that a good story may sprawl.
