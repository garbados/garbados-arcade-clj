My kobolds, what a joy it is to see you.

Gleaming Drg... how brightly your mind shines! What do you wonder today?

Oh, it hurts -- the crystal -- b-but, do not be alarmed, little ones. I remain yet.

Brave Yip! Your shield is as a dragon's own scale, stalwart as your spirit.

Ah, my scaly darlings, I have missed you.

Hm... What a wonderful dream... You were all there.

Yap, how are you so inconspicuous? You vanish before my eyes.

Grp, you're filthy. Is it one of your experiments again?

Knz, would you cook some more of that warg stew? I cherish the aroma.

Do you think you can retrieve something for me today?

Spelunking, are you? I wonder what you'll bring back.

Sometimes I think about the man who hurt me. I try not to.

Things can be... strange, this far down. But this is where I want to be, in the end.

Zzz...
