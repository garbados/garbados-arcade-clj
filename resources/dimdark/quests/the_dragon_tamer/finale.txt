You have the ring. I feel its oppressive aura; my enemy has made a tidy home of it. My beloved kobolds, you are without rival. Now, give it to me.

O Bond-Maker, Hear Me! Your priests are dead and your heralds too, your names forgotten and your temples buried. I have outlived the heights of your paltry deeds, and now I have your last icon, the symbol of your only grand accomplishment. Hear me when I say: you are dust and din, and now you are no more.

[The dragon crushes the ring between two claws. It falls away like sand, sundered pieces clanking on the stone floor like iron chains.]

It is done.
