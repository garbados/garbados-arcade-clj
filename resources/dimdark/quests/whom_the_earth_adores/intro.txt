Dragons have been around for a very, very long time.
But creation is much older still.
This world was already full of life
by the time the first dragon hatched.
And those creatures the planet first bore,
oh my dears,
it loves them the most.

It holds them close as they squeeze through its cracks
and swarm its deepest crevices.
It keeps them warm with molten stone
and feeds them sulfur and pressure.
The primordial pools may have been sky-facing waters,
but the oldest beings have migrated
down, down, down
into the furthest reaches of the Dimdark,
where in lightless bliss they pool again.

Slimes were the first,
though by my infancy
trolls had come to prominence.
Brutal, senseless, undying,
unequaled among predatorsâ€¦
it was only the use of fire
that carved a place for civilization,
which has proven no less violent.
Eon by eon they have retreated,
unaffected by age and unburdened by institutions,
deeper and deeper.
Humans and elves drove them from the surface,
dwarves from the undertop,
spiders from the upper dimdark.
Now their greatest masses have not seen sunlight for millennia.
The isolated individual or band
that grace these lofty reaches
are the exceptions to the rule of their diaspora.

But to tell this story,
I must speak of my oldest friend:
the slime I called Drizket.
A slime is little more than an advanced mold or algae,
with a bit of amoeba mixed in
and deprived of any fear of size,
but their translucent bodies and undifferentiated organs
miraculously do not deprive them of consciousness,
nor of the capacity to learn
and wonder.
They conquered the world entire
and transformed it three times over
before the first bone appeared in Creation,
with nary a ruin to speak for them.
