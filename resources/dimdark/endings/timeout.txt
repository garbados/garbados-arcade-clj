Oh no.
The time has come.

My kindred,
I have lived eons on this earth
and even you are like sparks --
starlight flaring, gone as soon --
but your love brings me such peace.
Even here in the empty dark,
I will perish knowing
that I have cherished others
and was cherished in turn
until my very last breath.

Goodbye, my darlings.
Goodbye.
I love you.
