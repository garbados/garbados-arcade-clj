Ah...
the time has come, my dears.
That awful hour has arrived.

You have done all that I asked,
and helped me close the chapters of my life.
Death comes for us all, even to dragons,
for that is the sublime order of life itself.
I pass on knowing love and triumph,
grief and mourning,
and every season of calm between.
I sleep now to dream immortal
of we who have cherished each other;
your love warms my departing spirit.
May my bones become soil
for a more fecund era.

Goodbye, my darlings.
Goodbye.
I love you.
