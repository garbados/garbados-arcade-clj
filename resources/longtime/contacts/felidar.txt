Foreign traders have come. They arrange their wares outside the lodges,
enticing the herd with delectable dumplings and artful pottery, fine combs and jewelry.
They know Minots, it seems, as they speak easily in the tongues of the herd.
Far to the west, the Felidar have a longstanding relationship with the herds of their savannahs.
The topic is a sensitive one.
Long ago, a Felidari regency used Minots as livestock, for labor and meat,
until the herds revolted.
A stampede of kept and wild herds alike burned a path from the farthest village to the capitol center,
where they set the city ablaze
and returned the regent to soil.
The subsequent regent, whose dynasty still reigns, guaranteed the autonomy of the herds,
and forbade the livestocking of any animal
larger than a common rat.
The traders' dumplings signify the enduring peace they now enjoy:
desert potatoes, peas and corn, and spices that evoke heat and sweetness all at once;
the Felidari culinarian's metaphors of choice for the dynamism of camaraderie.
As the herd and these welcome strangers break rations together,
they toast the possibility, indeed the certainty, of a bright future together.
