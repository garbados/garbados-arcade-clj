Intrepid Dod explorers meet envoys of the herd at the local lodge.
On two long avian legs, sturdy dark-feathered characters
entreat diplomatically, materialistically.
"We come in peace, on the diktat of the Consolidation Consortium,"
their leader recites, "On a mission to understand you."
They produce maps on the tables of the lodge,
and ask for assistance in making more maps.
With precise instruments, they seem intent on transcribing the world's span entire.
They prove equally interested in the herd's measurements of the stars,
inspiring the strangers to bring out even more maps, these of stranger sorts.
These Dods of the Consortium come from the glacial mountains of the northern pole,
where they have apparently been eking life from damp caves since time immemorial.
Now these hard-beaked, quant-minded birds have built flying contraptions
and deep-tunneled cities.
Worldly, they converse easily in Auter scripts;
prepared, an Auter translator accompanies them
to speak reflections of the words we do not yet share.
The clicks and grackling of their native tongue will remain a mystery,
but not for long.
Over fire and story, spiced wine and cracked nuts,
the explorers divulge the Consortium's greater ambitions:
"I admit we desire the stars," one croaks, deep in the cups of their home-borne brews,
"I have seen the mathematics to breach orbit.
I know the materials to reach those thresholds.
And I am not the only one.
The dream lives in many hearts,
and emerges through many beaks.
I think it is only a matter of time now."
An Auter raises a toast to the idea,
"To possibilities! May we ever have the choice."
