The trees have always been alive, of course,
since long before any mammal or avian or reptile walked the land.
The ground itself is thick with their passing, thick *from* it,
and the likes of root and mycelia contain memories of seasons unbounded.
They are not still, but flowing through branch and leaf and nodule,
over and around what the wind tells them they will find.
Their words are their deeds; the body of the forest is their manifesto.
That is, save for the Er'sol, who we have found may speak as we do.
Minots resting under the boughs of these contemplative beings
find their dreams inviting the mind of the arboreal;
eternity sprawls, and all spirits stand alive and present.
Strange concepts emerge from rooted minds,
and thorny problems borrow against their wisdom.
They liase between herd and thick green,
granting insight into its deepest arcana:
the dynamics of flourishing and famine,
wind and rain,
canopy and corpse.
To align with it is to become a part of its awesome dominion.
