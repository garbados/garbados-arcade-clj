Since even before the time of words,
small birds have lived alongside the herds,
plucking the flies and ticks that accumulate in Minot fur,
that swishing tails cannot dissuade from pestery.
A larger variety of such creature --
if only half a meter tall --
has made its sapience known with monuments.
Carefully stacked mounds of gems signify the societal ambitions
of a People that has lived beside the herds for ages.
The subtle bodily gestures that each has used to read the other
grow into functional tongues of symbols and referents,
whose subtletly remains intact -- the legacy of their ancient bond.
The Harps, as they call themselves, conduct a state of exchange:
an economy of face bound by decorum and willful deviancy.
They are eager to enact the pageantry of bartering,
of gem for stick and stick for stone,
delighting in the terms with a degree of covetous opportunism.
More than that, an excitement blossoms
of all that these avid little avians and determined ungulate-primates
might build together.
Aye, the dream blossoms: to dance together on the world,
to thrive together among the stars!
