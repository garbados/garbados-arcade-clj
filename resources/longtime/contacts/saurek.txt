The boating clans have come.
A beachside lodge has been voted this year's destination,
and the shore is lined with the flotillas of the clans.
Tall bipedal reptiles step from their many-masted wooden crafts
onto silver sands, clasping hands with one another after long absences.
Bonfires spring up, turning the horizon orange even in the dead of night;
in their midst, celebration proves boundless. Dancing and singing,
exotic delicacies and a hundred artisanal grogs.
Meanwhile, by a crackling fire in the lodge's den,
clan heads plan in somber hisses the distribution of their respective resources.
Clans spread as they do to seek plenitude and wisdom
for the glory and wellbeing of the clanmothers and all their hatchlings;
thus, they must swap resources to stave privation as befits clanright,
but who, to whom, and how much, of what, is necessarily contentious.
No one goes hungry, not in centuries, but a clan without face
has been known to know lean years.
By giftright, borrowers are expected to provide a gift for what is taken,
which provides an opportunity to attain face,
and in these meetings such things are also arranged.
But now, with such close proximity to the herd's syndicates,
more advanced material relations have developed and entrenched.
Minots load ships with goods and cherish gifted combs and earrings.
Such ties have proven enduring, and the sense of them colors the whole gathering.
Perhaps there will never be another lean year, the revelers dare to dream.
