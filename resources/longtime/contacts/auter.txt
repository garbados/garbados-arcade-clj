Rodents have taken up residence in the lodges, it seems.
Hardly a meter tall, they come with roasted nuts and detailed tapestries,
whose weaves encode formulas, algorithms, proofs, and arguments
for the shape and meaning of the world;
for the character of the lives they aspire to live.
The Auters, as they are called, take quickly to the tongues of the herd.
Eagerly they establish sign languages that their small paws and our large hands
may each employ, opening the door to a complex dialogue.
The meticulous mammals hail from an archipelago far to the south,
where for eons they have cracked urchins and oysters on their bellies.
This shard of them has come in search of strangeness and adventure,
for they delight in how the world sprawls endless,
replete with the miracles of life
and the mysteries of death.
