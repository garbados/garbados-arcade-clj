After a year of growling bellies, the herd disbands.
Starvation terrifies the masses, and the stampede that once encompassed you
now spills across the land, unmarshaled, uncontrolled.
Adults and children alike flee to seek more fecund ways
among other herds. The shared dream you embody shatters.
Eternity welcomes the wreckage of you back into its folds,
to be resewn into new visions and stranger futures
for another, luckier, pluckier herd.
