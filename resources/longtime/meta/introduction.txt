Are you there, some enduring era
of peace and plenty?
Hard winters and bare summers
have weakened our ways
and scattered our herd.
Only a few dozen of us remain now to walk
the ancient path.
I believe in us, you must understand!
I believe in old age and young laughter,
in the strength of all that we might share.
I dream of homes among the stars,
of a long time for me, for us all.
Are you out there?
I believe in you.
I pray to you:
tell me your name.
