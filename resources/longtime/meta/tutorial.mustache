Hail, O {{spirit}}!

A herd of Minots has prayed you into being; invested you with their hopes, and their skills.
It falls to you to shepherd them through the ages,
to decide, in subtle and decisive ways, where they go and what they do.

Minots have traversed the Gran-Imun-Yuliak supercontinent for eons,
in herds large and small, across ranges wide and narrow.
Their vast strength, rapid gallop, and four stomachs
have made them an herbivore atop a food chain.
Now an era of tools and crops begins to dawn,
while greater ambitions brew in the dreams
of humble ungulate-primates.

Each month, you will select three projects for the herd to enact.
These include grazing, gathering stones, or constructing buildings.
Check `projects` for more info on all the projects in the game.
At the end of each month, the upkeeps of hunger and sickness apply,
consuming nutrition and poultices respectively.
Without enough food or rations, the herd goes hungry, degrading its abilities.
If the herd remains hungry for an entire year, it will disband, destroying you.
Without enough poultices, sickness spreads, reducing effective skills.
After upkeep is applied, you will select the next location for the herd to travel to.
The herd's migration path consists of a loop of stages;
each stage has up to four locations, and you may travel to any location in the next stage.

At the beginning of each month, an event may occur.
Events are happenings that the herd handles on its own.
These may include weather events, interpersonal conflicts, plague and fire, and so on.
At the end of each month, a dream may occur.
Dreams represent the prayers of your people, and you may be prompted to answer them.
Your counsel will influence the dreamer as they forge their life.

There are six types of terrain in the game:

- Plains: grow crops in spring, harvest in summer or fall.
- Forest: flora grows over time; gather deadfall for wood.
- Mountain: good for stone-gathering, spelunking, and stargazing.
- Steppe: rush overland easily; cross this stage without passing time.
- Jungle: a tropical rainforest; a thick and vicious green.
- Swamp: gather bog-iron once a year.

Each stage of the herd's migration path may have up to four locations.
Each location may have up to four constructed buildings.

Eventually, your herd will possess the skills to explore new locations,
and to elongate the migration path to accommodate a larger herd.
For now, you walk a small loop from plains to mountain and back again.
Use `path` to look at your whole migration path.

Now you are ready to look after {{herd}}.
Will you see them to new homes among the stars?
Or will famine and want tear you apart?
