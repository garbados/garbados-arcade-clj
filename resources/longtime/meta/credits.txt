The Longtime is a labor of love.
I dreamed of being the subtle and decisive influence
that united the hopes of a great collective,
a maelstrom of effort across countless generations.
I did not want to watch my pawns scurry,
driven by inscrutible menus.
I wanted to be the heart of their ambitions!
So I made this game.

Much is owed to the prior art of games like
Rimworld, Kitten Game, Frostpunk, Dwarf Fortress, and Stellaris,
but especial thanks go to my partner Lucia Brody
for developing with me the whole universe of *The Shepherd*,
of which Minots are only a part.
