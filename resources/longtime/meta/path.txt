The herd's migration path consists of stages of up to four locations each.
At the end of each month, you will select a location from the next stage
to travel to.
Steppe locations can be crossed without spending a month,
though nor can you enact projects on steppes.
Longer paths may support larger herds,
though it takes significant organization
to adjust a migration like that.
