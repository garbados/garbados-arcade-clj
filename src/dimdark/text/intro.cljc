(def section1
  "Down into the grasp of the pitch void,
   where rot and ruin reign.
   Down between the cracks,
   mouth full of grit.
   Wriggle through the smalls of a shifting earth,
   and let it change you;
   the darkness, swallow you.
   There, things live sunless,
   illuminated by squalid magma and strange root.
   There, a dragon lays dying.")
(def section2
  "For thousands of years she had lived and reigned
   with kobolds at her beck and call;
   a faithful plenitude, a fruitful bond.
   So when a villain plunged into the dankness of the underworld
   to drive a crystal into her majestic heart,
   her pained cry brought the warren to its knees.
   The cur fled, but the wound stayed.")
(def section3
  "She advised the many of her warren to find more fecund reaches,
   for in her keep there lay nothing but decay.
   Sorrowful, they went in caravans.
   Some, however, stayed.")
(def section4
  "These six devoted kobolds defied her counsel out of love,
   so she decided to put them to use.
   She bids them to delve the dimdark below for the emblems and trinkets of her past --
   things that remind her of her life, her loves,
   and the brighter days of her spirit's dimming light.
   Some of these things are thousands of years old,
   but she knows exactly where they are,
   and she sends her faithful to obtain them.
   So, they do.")
