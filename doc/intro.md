## Acknowledgements

I try to honor my influences, at least as much as I steal from them.

This project would not be possible without generations of game developers expanding the intersection of game design and computer engineering with an exploding frontier of imaginative worlds. As much as I owe to authors like Ursula K Le Guin, Samuel R Delany, and Vonda McIntyre, I owe also to the ilk of Hideo Kojima, Shigeru Miyamoto, Danielle Bunten Berry, and Supergiant Games. More specific acknowledgements are also made within each game, as no single thanks could express what I owe to my peers and priors.
