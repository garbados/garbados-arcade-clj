# Equipment

Characters have three equipment slots: weapon, armor, and accessory. They can have one appropriate item at a time in each slot, and can swap them out between adventures or delves.

Equipment has a level derived from the difficulty of the area where it was found. This level is used to calculate the list of mods that may appear on the item, with more powerful mods being limited to higher levels.

## Implicit modifiers

Equipment types have implicit modifiers which modify some stats.

Accessories do not have implicit modifiers. They only have explicit modifiers.

## Explicit Modifiers

There are five tiers of modifiers, each providing +1 to a stat per tier. Equipment cannot have more than one modifier related to a single stat, so an item cannot have a +1 and a +2 to Attack but may have a +1 to Resistance and a +3 to Will Resistance.

An item must be of a level greater than or equal to the tier of a mod for that mod to appear on its list of potential mods. Weapons may not have mods from the Defense group, and Armor may not have mods from the Attack group.

## Rarity and modifiers

Pieces of equipment have rarity that reflects how many modifiers they have.

- Mundane: 0 modifiers.
- Superior: 1 modifier.
- Enchanted: 2 modifiers.
- Mythic: 3 modifiers.

Rare and mythic items have randomly generated names. Superior items have their modifier as a prefix, ex: *swift sabre*

## Crafting

Your dragon can break equipment down into *motes of essence* (or simply *motes*), a combination of mundane materials and their arcane aura. They can then fuse these motes back into equipment of your design. You can apply up to two modifier (the dragon cannot make mythic equipment) but they must be of the party's level or lower. The combined level of a design's mods plus one is the cost of the equipment in motes. Equipment breaks down into a number of motes equal to its rarity tier plus one (ex: mundane => 1, superior => 2, etc.).
