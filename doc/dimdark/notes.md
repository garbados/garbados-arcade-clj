Class and skill descriptions often have cool text! Check them while implementing!

Each scene grants one experience. After 20 experience, the party levels up; a year has passed. By 100 experience, the party will be at max level. *At 150 experience the dragon dies.* If the player completes Til Death before then, the kobolds manage to extract the crystal safely, saving the dragon and granting a different ending.

Til Death is unlocked with a journal found at Delving level 30.

*New Game Plus* begins at +20 experience, granting a free level but reducing the number of playable days and depriving the party of the loot it would have obtained in that span. There are thus only a few valid levels for New Game Plus, as at least 80 points are required to complete all the adventures and to find the map for Til Death: 0=>0, 1=>20,130; 2=>40,110; 3=>60,90. These correspond to Normal, Advanced, Expert.

New equipment paradigm:
- Each dragon has two preferred equipment types, with different implicits.
- Implicits scale with item level. Each level of each type has a different name. (Spear => Pike => Naginata, etc)
