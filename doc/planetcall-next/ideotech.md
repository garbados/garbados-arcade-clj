# Ideotech

A brief organizational overview of ideologies and their tech. In short, the primaries:

- Science: Pursuit of pure knowledge. Academies, hackers, cloaking, sensors, and wonders to overcome the barriers of the thinkable itself.
- Military: Martial supremacy. Big guns, bunkers, missile silos, command modules, and mods that make your guns bigger.
- Industry: Production and expansion. Trade pollution for productivity, deploy gas-hungry speeders and needlejets, destroy fungus and slay wildlife and colonize the land they called home.
- Contact: Empathy and cooperation. Increase trade income from treaties, multiply your trade income with forums and bazaars -- you may even learn to read minds.
- Ecology: Integration and harmony. Immunize units against miasma, construct dwellings in the hollows of fungal canals, sink pollution, and domesticate wildlife.

And the synergies:

- Science-Military: Precise, imaginative violence. Mech walkers, arc sentinel towers, mind control, and a doomsday wincon.
- Military-Industry: Violence at scale. Make more, faster. Hovertanks, bombers like floating cities, bigger factories, if at the cost of some creativity.
- Industry-Contact: Relic hunters, or, archaeologists. Take leaps and bounds by engineering with unearthed arcana, creating works you barely understand, scratching at mysteries you can scarcely comprehend. Gain automated units, construct features as if they were improvements, and ultimately uncover the mystery of the Planetcall.
- Contact-Ecology: The Cult of the Call. Tame dreamswarms, siege beetles, and wyrms and behemoths. Elevating the psychic to a place of worship. Symbiotize with Planet's cycles to move with its resilience and strength, and crush any toxic interlopers.
- Ecology-Science: Preservation and understanding of life. Build hybrid forests, tame arachnodons, and integrate fungus and miasma into your economy, while sinking eco-damage in basic improvements.
