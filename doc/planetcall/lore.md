# PLANETCALL: Lore

**WARNING: THIS FILE CONTAINS SPOILERS. TURN BACK NOW.**

Planet has hosted advanced civilizations for millions of years. Its first post-industrial people made peaceful contact with an alien culture and invited them to found an embassy on their world. As they worked together, their civilizations became astonishingly advanced. Having not found any other advanced civilizations, and having learned to conduct FTL comms, they construct the Beacon: a device that shunted a tremendous amount of energy into a higher dimension in order to warp spacetime so as to embed a message into a cosmological constant. Although estimates indicated this process would be harmless, it threw their technology into chaos and led to a cataclysmic event that destroyed their civilization. Survivors evolved into wild fauna and Planet's native psychic fungus buried the ruins in root and soil. But the Beacon had already been fired, and other peoples would continue to arrive.

The story of these strangers is always the same: fleeing a broken home, they construct an ark ship and answer the Planetcall, only to find their resolve shattered when they observe the ruin. It seems the fate of this torn world to attract doomed peoples.

Generally speaking, these peoples are doomed. They destroy each other, are destroyed by their hubris, or are consumed by the planet's fauna. Rarely, they escape. Subsequent visitors discover them only as ruins. Some peoples survive as remnant societies across the ages, growing into staid and defensive versions of themselves, wizened and cowed alike by the awesome power of Planet. However, no one lasts forever on this ship of fools.

The Signal will outlast Planet. In a few billion years, its system will fall into a singularity's orbit, and some billion years later be totally consumed. Then the Signal will simply point to the singularity, rendering the Planetcall nothing more than a fatal lure.

Perhaps that's what it always was.
