# Planetcall II

This document contains wild speculation and intentionally enormous undertakings. Should *Planetcall* receive a sequel, it will return to Planet to follow other arks from other peoples as they follow the planetcall's fatal lure.

## Randomly Generated Faction Casts

When the game begins, ten characters are created for each faction: one for each primary tree and each synergy tree. These characters may be of one or more total species, representing the possibility of the ark ship coming from a multisapient planet. The game randomizes species descriptors and genetic personality traits, and then derives a set of graphical avatar. These characters will physically change as your society develops, possibly gaining retroviral biomods or cybernetic enhancements.

A species has three attributes, and each character has one among their species' set of graphical avatars, and two personality traits. In addition each character has an expertise in a particular tree. Characters usually show up when their expertise becomes relevant to a scene.

Avatars include reaction sets, allowing characters to emote during dialogue to a limited extent.

### Species

Species are characterized by three properties:

- Material: The nature of the creature's makeup, particularly its flesh. Is it a crystal? A metallic being? A lizard, bird, or mammal?
- Manipulator: How is it that this species manipulates objects? Does it use a hand, tentacles, thought powers, or some other mechanism?
- Trait: A general adjective for the species, such as *hardy* or *brash*. This is drawn from the personality trait list, but applies to all members of the species.

Once these traits are set, a graphical avatar is drawn that becomes a template for characters of this species. In the case of Remnant societies, templates are saved for a single game so that they can be used in the next game.
