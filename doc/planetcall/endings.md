# Endings

There are seven ways to end the game, and each of them affect how the next game starts. When the game ends, some appropriate narrative text is shown to the player.

The effects of each ending are as follows:

- Cataclysm: Planet begins at cataclysm 1.
- Ark Launchpad: Default start conditions.
- Planet Buster: Spawn a *Doomsday* remnant. Planet begins with scattered pockets of radiation.
- Planetdream: Default start conditions.
- Beacon Institute: Spawn an *Archivist* remnant.
- Dimensional Gate: Default start conditions.
- Peace and Prosperity: Spawn a *Holist* remnant.

## Cataclysm

The sky has gone purple-black ebony with soot and spore. An abused Planet at last rejects the petty strangers that sought to upend its ancient order. Acid air eats away at every barrier, until with choking grasp it strangles every interloper. Frenzied fauna rampages through the remains, burying it as yet another layer of ruin within the mazes of Planet's depths. Perhaps the next to answer the Planetcall will bring a better fate than their own needless doom.

## Ark Launchpad

You were not meant to be here, so you have decided -- and managed -- to leave. Whatever glittering welcome this world's original inhabitants intended, there remains nothing but a stalwart font of anguish. Whatever one may accomplish to make a home on Planet, it is nevertheless a world of its own, with ways that have grown ancient over eons. You have a different home, one that has perhaps not yet succumbed to toxic mortal ambition. What else is there to do, but to return to preserve the place that made you?

## Planet Buster

In an indifferent universe, no fundamental ethic precludes atrocity. With a weapon in hand capable of obliterating the world entire, you cow your rivals with a threat of suicide. Power follows ambition like a wormtongue, whispering of cruel delights and vicious triumphs. In its embrace, you have found the will to conquer -- if not the wisdom to rule. A small, vestigial part of your conscience whispers, why have you brought these terrors here? Why could they not remain behind?

## Planetdream

As the Planetdream crackles to life, some invisible giant is born from the aether, a great new era shedding the old like snakeskin. The barriers separating you, an alien to this world, from its native systems are overcome at last: your people can hear its will, and it their very thoughts. Your faction aligns with Planet to exert a more dynamic self-preservation, birthing together a singularly conscious biosphere. No season brings famine, nor any corruption any temptation. Threats are pruned like sick leaves as the gardener and the garden transform into one eternal cycle. You have become a part of Planet, and thus have changed it forever.

## Beacon Institute

Deep beneath Planet's surface, an infernal machine sits still and dead. Fools used it to shunt unimaginable quantities of energy into the fabric of spacetime, ever so slightly and ever so precisely altering the geometry of reality, and embedding the Planetcall forever. Of course, peace and prosperity could not stay the harms of hubris. Even so infintesimal a change sent devastation rippling across the empire: crucial systems ceased to function, fundamental mechanisms halted irreperably, and altogether, all at once, the basis of their utopian abundance came undone.

But there is no undoing the Planetcall now. It is a part of reality, a part of how physics as you know it functions. The Beacon only placed the message; no device exists, or even could exist, which could revert its effect. All the curious travelers the Beacon's architects imagined befriending will go on coming to Planet, to find only ruin and decay.

## Dimensional Gate

An indifferent universe and the rewards of ambition have placed before you a galaxy to conquer. Applying diligent analysis and untold energy reserves, you have resurrected the portals that the people of Planet once used to travel between worlds. The still and dead remains of numberless alien lands open like flowers to the reach of your exploitation, to become the material basis of an eternal empire and a tireless war machine that crashes like tsunami waves upon any resistance. May the stars themselves shudder, for you dream of devouring them next.

## Peace and Prosperity

Civilization is a social practice -- something we do for each other -- not any physical monument or governing institution. It is the compassion to help and the patience to heal, the ambition to fly and the presence to feel. One realizes themself as part of something vast and humane, which lifts them like winds under wings. Together as one-and-many and many-as-one, the ark's survivors lay the foundations of the welcome they imagined receiving from Planet's ancients. Whoever next answers the Planetcall will find your people carrying on the essence of its invitation, an enclave of stalwart plenitude standing strong among the ruin -- a testament to togetherness that has put away the terrors of want and the temptations of envy.
