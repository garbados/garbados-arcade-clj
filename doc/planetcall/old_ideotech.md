# Ideotech

Ideotech are ideological technologies that factions research. Once researched their effects (including faction-wide passive abilities, access to new improvements or unit parts, etc.) as well as their restrictions (including reductions of certain yields or diplomatic limitations) apply immediately.

## Philosophy, Historiology

The philosophy of this representation of technological advancement opposes the linear historiology of classical 4X games such as *Civilization*. Any game about society inherently expresses a historiology, a theory of history, about that society and by allegory living societies too. This linearization of specific social and material developments renders invisible those societies whose beliefs and principles are structurally unthinkable to the historiology, limiting their inclusion to alienation and tokenization. There are ways of living, ways that people have lived, to which capitalism and imperialism were and remain unthinkable, just as much as those norms and relations are unthinkable to the kyriarchy. This hell we are forced to reproduce is not inevitable. It is totally unthinkable to me, and only through a dual consciousness am I able to navigate it at all.

Technology in *Planetcall* connects material advancements to the cultural norms that create the rationale for those advancements. To create a weapon, you must possess a rationale for its use; to construct a borehole, you must possess a rationale for such a land-relation; to choose to plant forests or grow fungus, too, require a rationale. These rationale become a shared cultural and practical pretext that shapes the institutions that architect daily life. Modes of land-relation and social-relation are not merely choices but become significant infrastructural commitments that limit and ultimately render unthinkable the integration of opposing systems of relation.

When Zakharov and Godwinson each developed practical applications for high-energy plasma, were they truly identical achievements? Would those distinct peoples find the same applications? And would they truly have such simple access to applications that would be alien to the rationales of their society? And if they would, then how different were their societies to begin with?

In a genre so tightly tied to settler-colonialism, I believe it is crucial for 4X games to critically examine the systems they use to represent conflicts and the development of different societies. You must be intentional with your historiology and take great pains to critically examine your presumptions, to consider who it is that your conclusions serve. We have many enemies in this painful era and too many have limbs in our minds and even our muscles.

## Experience

Experiences create rationales for thoughts even without choosing to think them. As your faction takes actions, it will accrue *experience* toward different primary trees. Experience acts as stored research points that are applied automatically when you begin researching an ideotech in that tree or its synergy trees.

- Gain Ecology experience for sinking eco-damage, constructing vegetation, or moving through fungus.
- Gain Science experience for generating knowledge.
- Gain Contact experience for signing and maintaining treaties.
- Gain Industry experience from constructing improvements or units.
- Gain Military experience from engaging in combat.

These different types of experience have different curves. It is likely that most societies will produce units or improvements and thus will accrue an incentive to research Industry ideotech, and societies cannot sink eco-damage without already researching Ecology ideotech. Experience gain is thus skewed to make accrual more even, but to some extent these varied curves are intentional. Colonial societies will face tremendous pressure to develop an exploitation rationale, while societies under fire will find it easier to develop tools for war. Meanwhile, societies that sink eco-damage will find it much, much easier to pursue Ecology ideotech and its synergies.

## List of Ideotech

### Science

The pursuit of pure knowledge, the dream of a unified materialist comprehension, leads to technically astonishing and practically limited achievements. It is a marvel to marvel at creation! The universe knowing itself. But as comprehension eclipses concern, a materialist society will find itself using some for the benefit of others.

#### 1. Scientific Method

Enables:
- *Laboratory* improvement, which yields +2 knowledge.

#### 2a. Distributed Networks

*By the grace of our collective wits we can communicate at the speed of light! Every day I say a prayer to the thirteen engineers who without even knowing it possess the power to dismantle it all.*

- Unit upkeep is increased by 1.

#### 3a. Genejack Vats

*Based on a survey of recent retroviral research, our team has been able to produce a fully-grown sapient humanoid under test conditions. The subject grew from artificial cells which were modified by a select set of engineered retroviruses, applying specific mutations. We humbly leave possible applications to the consideration of subsequent researchers.*

#### 3c. Autonomous Analysis

> The trouble has always been that you can't meaningfully diagnose what happens between input and output. Sure we can talk about curve-fitting and genetic algoritms, and I can even diagram the state of the AI at any point, but it remains impossible to truly say what an AI is thinking or why it thought that. All we can do is design them carefully, conduct rigorous training and review, and, frankly, hope for the best. Unless you plan on manually verifying everything our AI conclude, you're left with trusting them at their word.

#### 4b. Empowered AI

> The governor is a thing like and unlike me. They are whole and not a copy, capable of intent and ingenuity and ambition, but they bear the air of a simulacra, of a person imitating an affect. I feel sometimes like it is a nicety for my sake, and at others I feel like I am being herded. I fear we have given all license to beings who we have trained to train us into compliance. Is the governor the mechanism of my mechanization?

Enables:
- *Researcher* specialists yield +2 knowledge.

### Science-Ecology

It has become necessary to create plant hybrids, sometimes using Planet's flora, in order to sustain our bioregions. Luckily it appears to be working quite well.

Enables:

#### 4c. Meteorological Engineering

> Even the movements of nomadic herd animals affect the weather, and these effects compound over thousands of years. The winds become engines powered and shaped by innumerable sources, kickstarted by living processes as much as geologic ones, but some influences have greater impact than others. The butterfly might cause a hurricane, but we can too -- with much more certainty.

Enables:
- *Weather Planner* wonder, which grants the ability to create or destroy miasma or an Arkhane on a cooldown.

But there are comrades that swallow the most vile toxins and exhale a mere stench, and they are crucial too. Some have gone under the sea and built high-pressure laboratories where they feed on sulfur and heat. Planet is a vast place, and it invites us to join it -- if we are willing.
