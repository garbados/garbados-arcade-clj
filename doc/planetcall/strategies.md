# Strategies

Ideotech and alliances characterize the game's potential strategies.

## Solemnity

With highly-productive improvements and benefits from fungus, Solemnity readily sacrifices an action to solidify their domain. There, they remain in contemplation, to sit in forever with all that can manage to remain.

When confronted, Solemnity fields native fauna, and its other units gain buffs from fungus. They are not able to project power very far, but any invasion finds itself blunted.

As a defense against eco-cataclysm, native fauna deployed by players grows in strength considerably at higher eco-damage thresholds. The increased spread of fungus will also help such factions project power, to stop the culprits.
