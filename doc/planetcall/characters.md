# Characters

*Planetcall*'s character quotations follow the journey of a crew of several thousand envoys on a mission from Earth to greet an ancient interstellar society. When they arrive, that society seems to remain as nothing more than ruins. Pressed with a need to survive, the crew factionalizes around divergent ideas about how to make new lives on this alien world.

Formally codenamed *Arken Regards*, the mission was an endeavor of the Polynational Congress, a minor multinational legislature similar to the UN or NAM. The envoys chosen included diplomats, scientists, engineers, and a variety of other backgrounds and expertises. When the crew factionalized, leaders emerged that both guided and embodied the ethos of each faction. *Planetcall*'s writing makes frequent use of the remarks of these leaders and other crewmembers in order to illustrate the societies they inhabit, and how those societies evolve as their rationales advance from survival motives into complex ambitions.

There are ten leaders, one for each ideology both primary and synergy. They are:

- Deitrich O'Doyle, life support engineer, leader of Solemnity (Ecology)
- ???, head of seedbanks, leader of Stewardship (Ecology-Science)
- Petyr Gagarin, chief physicist, leader of Institute (Science)
- ???, ???, leader of Thinktank (Science-Military)
- ???, ???, leader of Jurisdiction (Military)
- ???, ???, leader of Complex (Military-Industry)
- Martin Augustus, paid-aboard tycoon, leader of Corporation (Industry)
- Francois Martin, engineblock supervisor, leader of Syndicate (Industry-Contact)
- Naya Anand, retired diplomat, leader of Federation (Contact)
- ???, sponsored artist, leader of Planetcult (Contact-Ecology)

Many other faction members make appearances, but generally only leaders have many excerpts.

You'll encounter characters in quotations, excerpts, and vignettes from two sources:

- Whenever you finish researching an ideotech.
- When certain events occur in the game, such as first combat.

Note that factions in an individual game do not represent these canonical factions. Rather, canonical factions exist to illustrate the nature of different ideologies.
