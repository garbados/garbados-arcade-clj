# Treaties and Diplomacy

## Treaties

Factions may ally or make war, in degrees measured by treaty levels. There are five levels:

- *Foes*: Factions may freely take aggressive actions against each other.
- *Neutral*: Faction units may not share spaces. Taking aggressive action automatically makes the factions into foes.
- *Friends*: Faction units may not share spaces. Impossible to take aggressive action; you must intentionally lower the treaty level first.
- *Allies*: Faction units may share spaces. Impossible to take aggressive action. Intentionally lowering the treay level forbids lowering it further for ten turns.
- *Partners*: Faction units may share spaces, and buffs from one faction's unit affect the other's too. Impossible to take aggressive action. Intentionally lowering the treay level forbids lowering it further for thirty turns.

These levels are ranked:

`{:foes -1 :neutral 0 :friends 1 :allies 2 :partners 3}`

At levels above zero, factions gain trade yields of each resource equal to the treaty level. For example, if faction A and faction B are allies, then each will gain two food, materials, energy, and knowledge at the beginning of their gathering phase. Trade pays for upkeeps before stockpiles, regardless of region.

## Diplomacy

Factions may broker trade deals between themselves, committing goods and intel to barter. The following may be traded:

- Primary resources (food, materials, energy)
- Units
- Claimed spaces
- Ideology Experience

As an example, a faction might barter units and spaces to another for resources and research.

Although human players can never truly be accounted for, it is a good rule of thumb that favorable trade relations make for closer friendships.
