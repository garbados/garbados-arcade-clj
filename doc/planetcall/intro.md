# Introduction to Planetcall

*PLANETCALL* is a turn-based multi-player strategy game, akin to a board game or something like *Civilization*. Players take the role of factions of people alien to Planet, faced with the need to survive under largely involuntary circumstances. While these fractious factions bicker and battle, the noxious and nightmarish Planet exerts its own strange will.

Players select landing zones independently, and then take turns placing infrastructure, building and commanding units, and otherwise changing the face of Planet -- and perhaps, being changed in turn. The game ends when a faction completes a *transformational wonder*, or when Planet has sustained too much ecological damage to sustain a biosphere.

## Acknowledgements

*Planetcall* would not be possible without prior art like *Civilization* and particularly *Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri*. (A more mixed acknowledgement is owed to *Beyond Earth*.) Thank you to Lady Deirdre Skye for intimating a critique of the genre, that I have endeavored to complete with this work.
