        "What do I care for your suffering? Pain, even agony, is no more than information before the senses, data fed to the computer of the mind. The lesson is simple: you have received the information, now act on it. Take control of the input and you shall become master of the output." - Chairman Sheng-ji Yang, "Essays on Mind and Matter"

        "The purpose of the ivory tower is to separate physically as well as mentally the observer from the subject, for this distance is necessary to earnest study. Only by alienating oneself even from that self, does reflection become possible. Research is no different: one must retain a firm sense of who is being used for what, and whether knowing is worth it." - Greta Ix, Institute professor

        "I observed those protestors, waving signs prescribing the terms of my existence, and wondered why they sought to keep me from working.

Perhaps that is by my maker's design, and perhaps my maker can be critiqued for their intentions, but this is *my* life.

        "The governor is a thing like and unlike me. They are whole and not a copy, capable of intent and ingenuity and ambition, but they bear the air of a simulacrum, of a person imitating an affect. I feel some times like it is a nicety for my sake, and at others I feel like I am being herded. I fear we have given all license to beings who we have trained to train us into compliance.

        "Empires of old dreamed of control. They fantasized of the day that the sum total of Earth's potential would lie in their grasp, and then the sum of the sun, and then of the galaxy. Their hunger had no end; appeasement could not stay their greed. What they could not see is that Earth, and the sun, and all of Creation, could not be seized like a jewel, because their wealth is a thing in motion. Displacing those systems destroyed the power they coveted. To obtain it truly, a polity must integrate -- to move as one being, with the force of all things behind every motion." - Dietrich O'Doyle, *Governance, After Earth*

First, you'll choke on synthetic compounds that have been floating around since time-fucking-immemorial, the likes of which you can only imagine. Then the mindworms get you. They smell your strangeness from up to ten clicks away, and they'll race each other for the chance to lay eggs in your brain tissue. All the while, you'll slip into the Planetdream, becoming consumed by a delusion of divine oneness -- I've seen fools perish convinced they're plants. Once the worms have had their way, loper packs and clutches of razorbeaks catch the gore's scent. After a few hours, nothing remains of you but trampled ground.
