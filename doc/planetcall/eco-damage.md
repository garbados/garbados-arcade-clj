# Eco-Damage

The world called Planet contains a wide array of flora and fauna that comprise a vivacious-if-deadly biosphere. Factions are all alien to this world, and their presence places ecosystems in a state of flux. The instability caused by player factions is tallied collectively as *eco-damage*. Claiming spaces, killing wildlife, and many other activities cause eco-damage. Some activities *sink* eco-damage, reinforcing Planet's biodiversity. As eco-damage crosses critical thresholds, Planet will become radically more dangerous for its alien visitors. After enough damage, the biosphere becomes unsustainable, and for some million-odd years, Planet hosts nothing but ruin.

Eco-damage has four thresholds with intensifying effects:

1. The icecaps begin to melt significantly, lowering the effective height of all spaces by one. Fungus expands more often, and more aggressively.
2. The icecaps continue to melt, lowering effective heights by one more. Native fauna becomes more plentiful and more hostile.
3. The icecaps melt entirely, lowering effective heights by two more. Catastrophic weather events manifest much more frequently, while mythic titans awaken in anger.
4. The biosphere collapses, rendering Planet uninhabitable for the time being and ending the game.

Note that Planet does not always begin with zero eco-damage. Sometimes you are left coping with the lingering influence of past visitors.
