# Radiation

Spaces can accrue radiation, either by possessing it when the game starts or as a result of the use of radioactive equipment and improvements.

Radiation comes in four levels:

- 0: No radiation.
- 1: Light radiation. Units take 1 damage for passing through it, and another if they end their turn on the space. Improvements on this space provide -25% yield.
- 2: Medium radiation. Units take 3 damage for passing through it, and another 3 if they end their turn on the space. Improvements on spaces with at least medium radiation provide no yield.
- 3: High radiation. The space becomes impassable to un-shielded units, and increases the radiation of a random adjacent space by one each turn.
