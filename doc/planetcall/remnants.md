# Remnants

A remnant society is a surviving shard of some ancient faction alien to Planet. They have learned to live on this world, antagonistically or in harmony, but their ambitions have become limited to guarding their place on Planet. Usually, remnant societies reflect the victor of the last game.

Remnant societies have an origin that determines their personality. For example, a Doomsday origin means that the society overcame their rivals through threats of using their planetcracking weapon. In all that time, the remnant has managed to avoid using it, but still aggressively threatens other societies with it in order to secure their holdings.

Remnants have special improvements with significant yields, as well as advanced units which are very difficult to defeat. If drawn into war, they will begin to produce more such units.

Players generally cannot establish treaties with remnants.

## Remnant Origins

Each origin determines which designs and improvements the remnant society uses. For example, a Doomsday remnant possess and produces different units than an Archivist remnant, and the yields of their improvements will differ as well.

- Doomsday: result of a prior faction completing the Planetbuster wonder. *Will attack units who get too close!*
- Archivist: result of a prior faction completing the Beacon Institute wonder. 
- Holist: result of a prior cooperative victory among all factions. *Players may form treaties with Holist remnants!*
