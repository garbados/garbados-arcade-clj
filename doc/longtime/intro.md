# Introduction to *The Longtime*

Take on the role of a Minot herd's revered spirit of the collective, the thread of all their shared dreams, *the Longtime*, and influence their monumental efforts as they travel an ancient migration path.

Minots have traversed the Gran-Imun-Yuliak supercontinent for eons, in herds large and small, across ranges wide and narrow. Their vast strength, rapid gallop, and four stomachs have made them an herbivore atop a food chain. Now an era of tools and crops begins to dawn, while greater ambitions brew in the dreams of humble ungulate-primates.

Each month you will decide on the efforts to which the herd devotes itself, and where it travels next along its migration path. You will also answer prayers, receive dreams, and witness events. Follow and guide the herd, from grazing ancestral plains, to traveling among the stars.

See [How to Play](./howtoplay.md) for more information on the concepts and mechanics of the game.

## Acknowledgements

I owe much to Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld, Kitten Game, and Frostpunk for the city-builder heart of *The Longtime*. But I don't want to watch my pawns scurry, compelled by inscrutable menus. I want the inspiration I bestow to be succinct and decisive, abstracted from physicality just as the player's very avatar is. I want to be the heart of their dreams. So I made this game.

Thanks are also owed to my loving partner Lucia Brody for collaboratively developing the world of *The Shepherd*, of which Minots are only a part.
